# Song_genre_classifier
This project builds a machine learning pipeline using PySpark to evaluate multiple classifiers, optimize them via cross-validation, and visualize model performance. It extracts feature importance for tree-based models and uses bar plots and confusion matrices to provide insights into classifier accuracy and predictions.
